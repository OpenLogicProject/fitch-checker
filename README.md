# fitch-checker

Kevin Klement's JavaScript/PHP Fitch-style natural deduction proof editor and checker

## Description

This is a demo of a proof checker for Fitch-style natural deduction
systems found in many popular introductory logic textbooks, such as Barwise &
Etchemendy's _Language, Proof, and Logic_ or Bergmann & Moore's _The
Logic Book_.

The specific system used here is the one found in _[forall x: Calgary
Remix](http://forallx.openlogicproject.org/)_, by P. D. Magnus, Tim
Button, J. Robert Loftis, Aaron Thomas-Bolduc and Richard Zach.  It is
based on [forall x: an Introduction to Formal
Logic](https://www.fecundity.com/logic/), by P.D. Magnus. However,
the proof system in the original version differs from the one used in
the _Calgary Remix_.

See it in action at
